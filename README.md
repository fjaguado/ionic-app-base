# Ionic App Base with ES2015/babel and scss

A starting project for Ionic that supports using custom SCSS and ES2015.

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

Then run:

```bash
$ ionic start myProject https://github.com/enguerran/ionic-app-base
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) repo.
